# MCP Servers Setup

This skill ensures proper configuration and usage of the self-hosted MCP server
stack across all repositories under your `${CODE_ROOT}` (the parent directory of
your projects).

## First Action — Always

**On every session start (first prompt), activate the Serena MCP server, recall
structured project memory from Omnigraph, and use Graphify when the repo already
has a graph:**

```
mcp_serena_activate_project(project="<ABSOLUTE path to the repo root>")   # never a bare name
# Recall typed memory (rules/decisions/preferences) for this project + global scope:
#   follow skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md (Omnigraph queries)

# If graphify-out/graph.json exists, prefer graph queries for broad structure questions
```

This loads the full project context: module structure, recent decisions,
commands, and constraints. Do this before any code changes — the memory graph is
the ground truth for what exists and how it works. Memory details:
`skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md`.

## Active MCP Servers

Each server's full usage lives in its own reference file:

- [Serena — Semantic Code Navigation (LSP)](references/serena.md)
- [Omnigraph — Structured Cross-Project Memory](references/omnigraph.md)
- [Graphify — Project Graphs](references/graphify.md)
- [Superpowers — Workflow Skills (14 skills)](references/superpowers.md)
- [Playwright — Browser Automation (UI validation, E2E)](references/playwright.md)
- [Context7 — Library Documentation](references/context7.md)

Infrastructure ([Harbor — Private Container Registry](references/infrastructure-harbor.md)) follows the infra MCP stacks
in its own reference file.

## Project Initialization

> ⚠️ **On coding.example.internal the Omnigraph stack is already deployed from
> `<site-repo>/mcp-servers/docker-compose.yml`** (canonical, Dockhand,
> viewer bound to `0.0.0.0:8090` for Caddy). The compose below is a **local/dev**
> variant — it binds `127.0.0.1` and shares the project name `mcp-servers`, so
> running it on coding.example.internal clobbers the live viewer and takes
> `omnigraph-ui.example.org` down. On coding.example.internal, manage the stack from the
> canonical Server compose instead. Use the below only for a standalone/dev host.

```bash
cd ${AGENT_SKILLS_ROOT}/infra/mcp-servers
docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.server --env-file ~/.config/autoos/site.env -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz                  # server up
python3 scripts/_omni_env.py                             # what stack docker actually has
```

## Recommended Workflow

1. Start the server: `docker compose --env-file .env.shared --env-file .env.server --env-file ~/.config/autoos/site.env -f docker-compose.server.yml up -d`
2. Activate Serena project: `mcp_serena_activate_project(project="<absolute path to the repo>")`
3. Recall memory from Omnigraph (see `skills/structured-memory/SKILL.md`)
4. Build or refresh Graphify graphs when the repo has a graph target
5. Use Serena for navigation, Omnigraph for memory, Graphify for graph queries, and Superpowers for workflows
6. End session: persist durable decisions to Omnigraph; services keep running

## Troubleshooting

```powershell
# Full health check
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz                  # omnigraph server
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/graphs

# Serena
serena project list
serena --version

# Omnigraph (open health probe, then an authenticated call)
curl -fsS http://localhost:8080/healthz
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $env:OMNIGRAPH_TOKEN" http://localhost:8080/graphs

# Ollama (optional — embeddings only)
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags
```
